    <div class="page" title="Page 1"><br><div class="layoutArea"><br><div class="column"><br><br>The fateful final question of all interviewers may carry more weight than you would think. Upon hearing “Now, do you have any questions,” you are given a chance to show the quality of your character and interest in the company. No matter how well the interview went, passively responding to this question with a shake of the head and a polite smile will only communicate to the employer that you are not interested in inquiring about the job, the company, and your place within their organization.<br><br>Your approach to this Question &amp; Answer time will directly impact the interviewer’s assessment of you and the interview.<br><br>When thinking of questions the first things that probably come to mind regard your salary, hours, vacation, and benefits. It is not a good idea to ask these types of questions during this time. It would only express to the employer that you are more concerned about yourself than learning about the company. These kinds of questions are valid only when a job offer has been made.<br><br>When preparing for this part of the interview develop questions regarding the company or the organization. This will positively influence your interview by showing that you care more about the company and the job than just how much they will pay you. Good questions to ask are:<br><br><em>   How would you describe your company culture?
</em>   What is the typical career path for someone in this position?<br><em>   What is your company’s biggest challenge?
</em>   Where do you see this industry in the next five years?<br><em>   Who is your competition and how do you compare?
</em>   How does your company measure success?<br><em>   What skills are the most important for this position?
</em>   Describe your ideal employee.<br>*   Tell me about the people I’d be working with.<br><br>Not only will these questions indicate to the interviewer if you are right for the job, but their answers will indicate to you if the job is what you’re looking for. Just as you may not be a perfect fit for all companies, not all companies are a perfect fit for you. Just as you try to sell yourself to a company, a company should try to sell themselves to you.<br><br></div><br></div><br></div>
