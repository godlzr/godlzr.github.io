Tell me a little bit about yourself. (1’ 30’’)"></a>1.    Tell me a little bit about <strong>yourself</strong>. (1’ 30’’)</h2><ul>
<li>My name is Zhongrui LI, I have graduated from University of Ottawa with Master degree in this March(2015), my program is Electrical and Computer Engineering.</li>
<li>During the past two years, I worked as a research assistant in the field of computer graphics, and my research direction is 3D reconstruction and image processing.</li>
<li>I have experience with computer graphics related development and Java web development. I am solid in C/C++, Java, Matlab, Python (and some computer vision related technologies, like OpenGL, OpenCV and so on).</li>
<li>Also I had been TA for networking course, I am greatly interested in network area, and I have solid knowledge background of the networking, and I am familiar with the common networking protocols.</li>
<li>Besides my technical experience, I am also motivated person and a quick learner.</li>
<li>And I think I am a good team player. I have always worked well with others but I have no troubles getting my work done independently.</li>
<li><strong>I know Cisco is the leader in the networking market, it designs, manufactures and sells great networking equipment and also provides advanced technologies and softwares to the world.  It also set the industry standards in the networking area. So, in my heart, cisco is the real leader and super company in networking market, and I have great passion of working in cisco, it’s really my dream company, and I really appreciate this interview opportunity.</strong></li>
<li>(I really enjoy research and development work in the CG field and this position is exactly what I am looking for.) Thus, I really appreciate this opportunity for this interview.<br>*</li>

<h2 id="2-Let-me-know-how-exactly-you-labored-effectively-to-pressure-situation"><a href="#2-Let-me-know-how-exactly-you-labored-effectively-to-pressure-situation" class="headerlink" title="2.    Let me know how exactly you labored effectively to pressure situation."></a>2.    Let me know how exactly you labored effectively to <strong>pressure situation</strong>.</h2><ul>
<li>Actually, during the master-study, I always faced pressure and deadlines, I do not mind the stress, and I think stressful situation is a learning and challenging experience.</li>
<li>For example, my supervisor always give me some extra work and tasks when deadline was approaching, she usually got some new ideas when the work should be done and want me to test if her idea is correct.</li>
<li>When I was getting into this situation, your time is limited, but you have to face multiple tasks, the first thing I do is to sort the tasks by their priority, and I prefer to finish the most important and urgent thing first.</li>
<li>Then I would make a schedule to allocate my time properly, and I would follow this schedule strictly, so that I can finish my daily work and make sure the whole plan can be completed.</li>
<li>I think I can handle most of stressful situation by this kind of approach.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-How-to-be-more-efficient-at-work"><a href="#3-How-to-be-more-efficient-at-work" class="headerlink" title="3.    How to be more efficient at work"></a>3.    How to be more <strong>efficient </strong>at work</h2><ul>
<li>I think the most important point is to keep a consolidated work schedule and follow it strictly,</li>
<li>And I will eliminate personal distractions such as silent my phone or close the social apps. So that I can focus on my work.</li>
<li>I think hard work with a tired body and brain is low efficiency. Keep relax and never make brain tired, have rest after a long time hard work to relax body and brain, which can help to increase work efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-What-do-you-feel-are-your-great-strength"><a href="#4-What-do-you-feel-are-your-great-strength" class="headerlink" title="4.    What do you feel are your great strength?"></a>4.    What do you feel are your great <strong>strength</strong>?</h2><ul>
<li>My strengths are problem analyzing, software programming. With my education and experience, I become solid in general programming, analyzing and debugging.</li>
<li>I think my strength is my flexibility to handle change. I can adapted to the change quickly and revise my plan and schedule based on the change. Keep me on the correct path.</li>
<li>And I am self-motivated, I never satisfy with small achievement and always looking for a better way to achieve my goal.</li>
<li>My attitude is my strength. The way I think gives me confidence to complete my task, no matter how hard the task is.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="5-What’s-your-weakness"><a href="#5-What’s-your-weakness" class="headerlink" title="5.    What’s your weakness?"></a>5.    What’s your <strong>weakness</strong>?</h2><ul>
<li>Well, I think maybe I have a bit of dependence issue, that I am dependent on my familiar work tools and technologies. Basically, I prefer to use the tools and technologies, which I am proficient in. But that doesn’t mean I don’t like to learn new stuff, I mean I am little conservative and more willing to finish my work more reliable.</li>
<li>And I think I don’t have super memory to memorize all technique details, sometime when I was not sure with a knowledge point or an issue, I need to search it and make sure I am doing correctly, so may this work type will reduce my efficiency.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="6-How-do-you-react-to-instruction-and-criticism"><a href="#6-How-do-you-react-to-instruction-and-criticism" class="headerlink" title="6.    How do you react to instruction and criticism?"></a>6.    How do you react to <strong>instruction and criticism</strong>?</h2><ul>
<li>I would receive and execute instructions immediat</li>
<li>And I would also accept criticisms form anybody (leader or colleagues), although sometime the criticism may be incorrect, but I accept it first and try find a proper time to discuss the criticism with my leader and colleague.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="7-How-do-you-handle-conflict"><a href="#7-How-do-you-handle-conflict" class="headerlink" title="7.    How do you handle conflict?"></a>7.    How do you handle <strong>conflict</strong>?</h2><ul>
<li>Well, conflict is always happened in daily life and work. I am not a rash person and I will handle conflict</li>
<li>I believe communication is the best way to resolve conflict. Communication can help people understand others’ situation.</li>
<li>I am really a good communicator and I am willing to review the conflict by another perspective and try to find a resolution, which can satisfy each other.</li>
<li>For example, before my thesis submission,</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="8-Why-do-you-think-you-are-a-smart-person"><a href="#8-Why-do-you-think-you-are-a-smart-person" class="headerlink" title="8.    Why do you think you are a smart person?"></a>8.    Why do you think you are a <strong>smart person</strong>?</h2><ul>
<li>I think smartness is not only about intelligent, It also about on our thinking and our attitudes and our abilities.</li>
<li>First, I am confident with my intelligence, and I think I am serious person, I always pay attention to details and I have a can-do attitude.</li>
<li>And I’d like to acquire wide range knowledge, that expands my perspective.</li>
<li>In addition, I think I am a good communicator, and I am willing to ask for help, if I got some problem that I can resolve by myself. I recognize that other’s intelligence and help are an important factor on my path to success.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="9-What-salary-are-you-expecting"><a href="#9-What-salary-are-you-expecting" class="headerlink" title="9.    What salary are you expecting?"></a>9.    What salary are you expecting?</h2><ul>
<li>Well, I know money is an important factor, but it is not the most important thing for me in this stage.</li>
<li>I really think this position in your company is a great opportunity for me to start my career, it’s more important for me to work in this field and acquire more knowledge and skills, and work in a growth-oriented company and I really like a start-up environment.</li>

<h1 id="Projects-Description"><a href="#Projects-Description" class="headerlink" title="Projects Description"></a>Projects Description</h1><h2 id="1-Hair-Project"><a href="#1-Hair-Project" class="headerlink" title="1.    Hair Project"></a>1.    Hair Project</h2><ul>
<li>The 3D hair reconstruction project is also my thesis project. We design a capture system, which includes 4 kinects and 4 DSLR cameras, We use Kinect to capture the 3D depth information of real-life hair model, and we also capture 2D image using DSLR camera.</li>
<li>For the Kinects, we calibrated the all Kinects in order to align the depth data from all Kinect devices. And we built the mapping relationship between 2D and 3D by calibrating the DSLR camera and Kinect and calculate the transformation between their space coordinates.</li>
<li>Then we used image-processing approach to track the 2D hair strands on hair image, after that we project 2D hair strands on 3D space to get the 3D hair strands.</li>
<li>Finally, we import the 3D data of hair strands into Blender (a 3D graphic software) and reconstruct the 3D hair model, and we also do some simulation and make some animation based on our hair model.</li>
<li>We also developed the software GUI using C++ and Qt framework.</li>
<li>So, in this project, we use different languages like, C++, matlab and python and I got familiar with OpenGL, OpenCV, Qt, and Kinect SDK. We also published two papers based on this project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="2-3D-Tongue-Reconstruction"><a href="#2-3D-Tongue-Reconstruction" class="headerlink" title="2.    3D Tongue Reconstruction"></a>2.    3D Tongue Reconstruction</h2><ul>
<li>In this project, we use a series of ultrasound images to reconstruct the 3D tongue. We selected a series of control points and calculated their 3D position, and then we deform a generic tongue model based on the control points we got from the ultrasound images.</li>
<li>In this project, I developed the software GUI and create tongue movement animation using C++, MFC and OpenGL.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="3-Haptic-Based-web-3D-Game"><a href="#3-Haptic-Based-web-3D-Game" class="headerlink" title="3.    Haptic Based web 3D Game"></a>3.    Haptic Based web 3D Game</h2><ul>
<li>Actually, this is a course project of Virtual Environment, we were asked to develop a Virtual Environment related program. We have two people in our group, and at that time, my partner hold a haptic device and I was doing research on computer graphics, so we decided to developed a haptic based 3D game, to use the haptic device as game controller.</li>
<li>We used WebGL framework so the game is browser based and we designed and implemented the game logic using JavaScript. And we create the 3D characters and scenes and movement animation, using Blender. My partner developed a Chrome haptic plugin (extension) to connect Chrome browser and haptic device so that we can integrate the haptics into our game.</li>
<li>Briefly, we developed a 3D third perspective shooting game, the user (player) can control the character to move using Keyboard, and rotate the view point, jump and shoot using the haptic device similar to mouse, but, if there is any interaction between your character and other object, you can feel the force feedback from specific direction though the haptic device. For example, if you jump, you can feel the gravity represented by a downward force, if you hit your character on the wall you can feel the impact force, and if you are under attack and get hurt you will feel Vibration from the haptic device.</li>
<li>The game was well implemented and interesting, we add many funny factor and audio and video in it. Finally, we got full marks.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="4-Internship-Java-Development"><a href="#4-Internship-Java-Development" class="headerlink" title="4.    Internship- Java Development"></a>4.    Internship- Java Development</h2><ul>
<li>During my internship in ChinaSoft International, I worked in a ten people group and we developed a J2EE web based financial management system.</li>
<li>We use Struts 2, Spring and Hibernate integration framework. I design and implement the system database using Oracle 10g.</li>
<li>And I also participate the backend development such as DAO layer and service layer, and frontend development. I am a good team player and I worked well with others, finally, our project got the excellent project award.</li>
</ul>
